const voiceFAQs: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Will customers know they're talking to an AI?",
    answer: "Our AI voice technology is designed to sound natural and conversational. We're transparent about the AI nature when appropriate, but the experience is so seamless that many customers won't notice the difference. For businesses preferring complete transparency, we offer customizable disclosure options."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI handle complex customer requests?",
    answer: "The AI is trained to handle most common service requests and questions. For complex situations beyond its capabilities, it seamlessly transfers to your human team with a complete context of the conversation, ensuring a smooth handoff without frustrating the customer."
  },
  {
    question: "How much time will this save my business?",
    answer: "Most service businesses using our voice automation save 15-20 hours per week on call handling alone. This includes answering routine inquiries, scheduling appointments, and making outbound reminder calls. Your team can focus on higher-value activities while the AI handles repetitive communication tasks."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the voice and scripts?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can select from multiple voice options or even create a custom voice that matches your brand. All scripts are fully customizable to reflect your business tone and terminology. We provide templates as starting points that you can modify to your exact needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if the system goes down?",
    answer: "We've built our voice system with redundancy and 99.9% uptime guarantees. In the rare event of system issues, calls are automatically routed to your preferred backup number, ensuring you never miss important customer calls. We also provide real-time status monitoring through our dashboard."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need special equipment to use this?",
    answer: "No special equipment is needed. Our system integrates with your existing phone system or can provide a new business number. The entire setup is cloud-based, requiring only an internet connection to manage through our web dashboard."
